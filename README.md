# QR-Code-Generator
A QR code is a type of two-dimensional matrix barcode, invented in 1994, by Japanese company Denso Wave for labelling automobile parts.


This repository contains two Python programs that generate QR codes.

simple_qr_code_generator.py takes a link or text as input and generates a simple QR code.  
customized_qr_code_generator.py takes a link or text as input and allows you to customize the size, color, and border of the QR code.  
To run these programs, you will need to install the qrcode and PIL Python packages.

Installation  
To install the qrcode and PIL packages, run the following commands:  

    pip install qrcode
    pip install Pillow

Usage  
To run the simple_qr_code_generator.py program, pass the link or text you want to encode as the program's argument.

To run the customized_qr_code_generator.py program, pass the link or text you want to encode, as well as the size, color, and border of the QR code.   
Output    
The output of both programs is a QR code image file. The file will be saved in the same directory as the program.
